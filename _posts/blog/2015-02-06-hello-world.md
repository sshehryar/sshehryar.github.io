I'm Ali Shehryar, a self proclaimed stoic and pseudo writer, among many other things. I'll be blogging about things I like, on being [anti-fragile], on what life has taught me and on living the strenuous life and why it has become absolutely necessary in today's world.  On a parallel note, you'll get to see my ramblings on Programming, Linux, C/C++, Javascript and Embedded Systems.

Too often people, in an attempt to demonstrate their intellectual prowess, write boring, long winded posts on topics that demand simplicity. You won't find such bull-shit here.
